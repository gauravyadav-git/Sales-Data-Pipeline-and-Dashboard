Sales Data Pipeline and Dashboard
📌 Overview

This project demonstrates the end-to-end development of a sales analytics pipeline and dashboard for a computer hardware business. The goal was to streamline reporting, track key sales KPIs, and generate actionable insights for decision-makers.

The pipeline begins with raw sales transactions stored in a MySQL database, followed by SQL-based ETL processing for cleaning and transformation. The cleaned data is then connected to Power BI, where advanced DAX calculations and visualizations are used to build an interactive dashboard.

By leveraging this pipeline, business leaders can monitor revenue, sales quantities, customer contributions, and market performance in real time, leading to improved decision-making and timely interventions.
